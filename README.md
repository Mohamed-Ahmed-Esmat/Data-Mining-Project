# Diabetes Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes based on various health-related attributes. The dataset used includes information such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and insulin levels. We preprocess the data, analyze critical attributes, and apply machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify correlations and trends.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying critical features that have the most influence on diabetes prediction using statistical methods.
- **Modeling**: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM) to classify individuals based on their health data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset includes health attributes of individuals.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing data through imputation or removal.
   - Normalize or scale the numerical attributes.
   - Encode categorical attributes as needed.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize the relationships between attributes (e.g., correlation heatmaps, box plots).
4. **Critical Feature Identification**:
   - Use correlation analysis, feature importance, or statistical tests to determine the most relevant features for predicting diabetes.
5. **Model Training**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train multiple models and fine-tune parameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
